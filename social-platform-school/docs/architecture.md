# Architecture of the Social Platform for School Announcement and Events

## Overview
The Social Platform for School Announcement and Events is designed to facilitate communication and interaction among students and administrators. It provides a space for posting announcements, events, and allows users to engage through comments and reactions. The platform also includes a chat feature for real-time communication.

## System Architecture

### 1. Client-Server Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture where the client (browser) interacts with the server (PHP backend) to perform various operations. The server processes requests and sends responses back to the client.

### 2. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL (managed via PhpMyAdmin)
- **Server**: XAMPP

### 3. Directory Structure
- **public/**: Contains the entry point files and assets.
  - **index.php**: Main entry point for the application.
  - **admin.php**: Admin functionalities.
  - **chat.php**: Chat functionalities.
  - **assets/**: Contains CSS and JavaScript files for styling and client-side logic.

- **src/**: Contains the core application logic.
  - **Controller/**: Manages the flow of data between models and views.
  - **Model/**: Represents the data structure and interactions with the database.
  - **View/**: Contains templates and partials for rendering the UI.
  - **Service/**: Contains business logic and services for various functionalities.
  - **Middleware/**: Handles authentication and authorization.
  - **Helpers/**: Utility functions used throughout the application.

- **config/**: Configuration files for application and database settings.

- **database/**: Contains migration scripts and seed files for database setup.

- **docs/**: Documentation files, including architecture and setup instructions.

- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for server management.

- **tests/**: Contains unit and feature tests for the application.

### 4. Key Components
- **User Management**: Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
- **Post Management**: Allows admins to create, edit, and delete announcements and events.
- **Commenting System**: Users can comment on posts and tag other users.
- **Reactions**: Users can react to posts and comments using emojis.
- **Chat Functionality**: Real-time chat feature with group chat support and message history.
- **Event Calendar**: Displays upcoming events for users.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Admins can view user engagement metrics.

### 5. Database Schema
The database schema includes tables for users, posts, comments, reactions, messages, and events. Each table is designed to efficiently store and retrieve data relevant to the application's functionalities.

### 6. Security Considerations
- User authentication is managed through secure login and registration processes.
- Input validation and sanitization are implemented to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Sensitive data, such as passwords, are hashed before storage.

### 7. Future Enhancements
- Implementing additional features such as notifications, user roles, and enhanced search functionalities.
- Improving the user interface for better accessibility and user experience.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the Social Platform, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and a user-friendly experience.
