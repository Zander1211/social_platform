Each message type has distinct visual styling:

- **Success Messages**: Green gradient background with check icon
- **Development Messages**: Yellow/amber gradient with code icon
- **Info Messages**: Blue gradient with info icon
- **Error Messages**: Red gradient with warning icon

### **Message Structure**
```html
<div class="message-type" role="alert">
  <i class="icon"></i>
  <div class="message-content">
    <div class="message-title">Primary Message</div>
    <div class="message-details">Additional details and guidance</div>
    <!-- Development mode only -->
    <div class="test-link">
      <div class="test-link-title">Development Test Link</div>
      <a href="...">Reset Password Now</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **AuthController Response Format**
```php
return [
    'status' => 'success|error',
    'message' => 'Primary message text',
    'message_type' => 'email_sent|development_mode|security_neutral|email_error',
    'details' => 'Additional explanation text',
    'token' => 'abc123...' // Only in development mode
];
```

### **Environment Detection**
```php
$isDevelopment = (defined('APP_ENV') && APP_ENV === 'development') || 
                 (!defined('APP_ENV') && $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] === 'localhost');
```

### **Message Type Mapping**
- `email_sent` → Green success message
- `development_mode` → Yellow development message with test link
- `security_neutral` → Blue info message
- `email_error` → Red error message

## 🛡️ **Security Features**

### **Email Enumeration Prevention**

- Prevents attackers from discovering valid email addresses
- Maintains consistent response timing

### **Token Security**
- Tokens only shown in development mode
- Production mode never exposes sensitive information
- Clear expiration and usage messaging

### **Error Logging**
- Failed email attempts logged for monitoring
- Sensitive errors logged but not displayed to users
- Proper error tracking for debugging

## 📱 **Responsive Design**

### **Mobile Optimization**

## 🔄 **User Flow Examples**

### **Successful Password Reset (Production)**
1. User enters email → "Instructions sent to your email"
2. User clicks email link → Reset password form
3. User enters new password → "Password reset successful!"
4. User redirected to login

### **Development Testing Flow**
1. User enters email → "Development Mode" message with test link
2. User clicks test link → Reset password form
3. User enters new password → "Password reset successful!"
4. User can immediately test login

### **Security Flow (Invalid Email)**
1. User enters non-existent email → "If account exists, you'll receive instructions"
2. No email sent (email doesn't exist)
3. User doesn't receive email (expected behavior)

## 🚀 **Production Deployment**

### **Email Service Configuration**
To enable production email sending:

1. Configure SMTP settings in `EmailService.php`
2. Set `APP_ENV=production` environment variable
3. Test email delivery
4. Monitor error logs

```php
// config/app.php
define('APP_ENV', 'production'); // or 'development'
```

### **Monitoring**
